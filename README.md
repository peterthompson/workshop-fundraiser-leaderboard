# Workshop Fundraiser Leaderboard

The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to authoring and testing React.js applications.

We will cover,

* Bundling an application with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
* Transpiling code with [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
* Creating UI components with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react)
* Testing an application with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest)

We will build an application that shows the top 10 fundraisers for a given charity on the [JustGiving](http://www.justgiving.com) platform.

In an appropriate location on your system create the project.
